# SimCompaniesAnalysis

I am The Pollution Co. ingame. I delevoped this a few months ago. Once I had it running a bit of analysis and you basically had won the game. That was never really the appeal to me, but it may be for you.

IMPORTANT:
1. THIS IS NOT A BOT. IT DOES NOT PLAY THE GAME FOR YOU, ONLY DOES THE MATH AND TELLS YOU HOW BEST TO PROFIT.
2. THIS IS ALLOWED TO RUN --ONLY-- IF YOU DO NOT INCREASE THE API THROTTLE.

The difference between this and the google sheets? This is more efficent, captures more detail of the market including volume, faster.

Run different .py files. They do what they say on the tin.

main-online.py or main.py is what you need running on a server. It watches the exchange.

Some API connection may be out of date. I am not supporting them.

I have added API throttling. Please don't disable this. Decreasing the throttle or removing it may lead to a permaban.
